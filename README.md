# cortez
Geographic data from Steinbeck and Ricketts 1940 trip. This is the original R package, which includes the data cleaning, while the python package just includes the data. 

Note that the locations were taken from (Amanda Chengs delightful story map)[https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/a65d2eacff1d4bd7b59796edff1f2211]. 
The 'route' of the Western Flyer is liberally digitized from Penguin Classics 1995 edition of *The Log from the* Sea of Cortez; of which I am not sure of the actual accuracy of.
